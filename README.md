# pyMkDocs Utility

## What is pyMkDocs?
pyMkDocs is a tool to generate documentation for Python projects.
It extends the features of [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org).
It is, itself written in [Python](https://python.org).

## Why was this project created?

[MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org) is an amazing tool to generate a website with 
Markdown. Until now, however, there 
was no tool for *auto generating* a MkDocs project from Python source.

The typical starting point when comparing Python documentation generators, is
the standard library's [pydoc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html) module. 
While that tool is easy to use, it's not flexible, and the end result leaves 
something to be desired. In contrast, many would consider the "gold standard" for
auto generating Python documentation to be [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).
But that tool is complicated, and uses 
[reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText).
Too bad reStructuredText *sucks*, 
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) *rocks*!

As the real work involved in documenting your code will end up revolving
around writing [Doc Strings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) one way 
or another, being able to express yourself in that context via Markdown will make
you HAPPY for a long time to come!

## How do I install it?

`pip install pymkdocs`

## Recipe to make it work:
  - Ingredients:
    - 1 folder containing Python source files (e.g. the `example` folder in this repo)
    **OR** 1 fresh `pip install`
    - (OPTIONAL) custom Docstrings and/or "magic comments" included in source (see below)
 
  - Easy steps:
    - Install pyMkDocs.
    - Open a terminal and change to the project directory. Example: `cd pymkdocs`
    - Run pyMkDocs. Example: `pymkdocs example/src example -r -c -s`
    
Command line help:

```

This utility generates MkDocs websites from Python source code.
Help:  pymkdocs -h/--help
Usage: pymkdocs source destination [-m/-r] [-c] [-s]
-m: magic mode (default) / -r: raw mode
-c: include source code
-s: serve test site
```
 
## How does this work?
pyMkDocs analyzes your Python source and generates markdown files from them.
It then employs MkDocs to produce html based documentation from the markdown!
This process creates:
  - a 'mkdocs.yml' file, which is a config file for [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org)
  - a 'docs' folder, containing the markdown 
  - a 'site' folder, which is the final web site produced 

### Raw Mode

The easiest way to learn to use pyMkDocs may be to first run the example 
provided in "Raw Mode". Pass the `-r` switch on the command line to enable 
this option. Using this method for generating the documentation, the entire
directory tree for a source path specified is recursively scanned and all 
elements of the code indexed. The files produced have a direct one-to-one 
alignment of Python package / module to a sub directory / document 
(i.e. site page).

This is the most straightforward style for indexing the exact source 
found within that Python code base in a literal manner.    
 
### Magic Mode
  
Now that you've seen how easy it is to use "Raw Mode", let's dive into "Magic Mode"!   

"Magic Mode" is used to generate documentation sites in a more dynamic,
customizable manner. The key difference between this mode vs. "Raw Mode", is that
the method by which objects are indexed is "by import" rather than by "file path".
This mode also provides the means to define the structure of the content produced
to a notable degree.

The way objects are found in this mode aligns with how the content of a package 
naturally resolves via import within a Python runtime context. The source elements 
which are explicitly included within a given Python package's `__init__` module 
will be indexed by the doc generator's parser / inspector. 

The command line argument passed for the "source" argument may simply be the 
name of an import. That argument does not have to be the path to its directory, 
when using this mode. Therefore, after "pip installing" any library (including
from remote or *local* sources), you could follow that up by running `pyMkDocs` 
against it *by import name*!     

As a bonus, when using this mode, "magic comments" (using syntax defined for this
specific tool) will be processed if placed within such an `__init__` module being
scanned. This is used to dictate how the markdown files / site pages will be named
and ordered, along with what content is generated.

Let's look at an example "magic init" file...   

**example/src/__init__.py**:

```py3
"""
This library is very impressive... :)
"""
# docs > Introduction.md
# docs : __doc__ 

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# docs > Mini.md
""" docs : prose
Here is some preamble text for the page...  
"""
from .functions import mini, MIN_SIZE
""" docs : prose
Closing comments on these functions...  
"""

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# docs > Shark.md
""" docs : prose
This page is devoted to the **Shark**.  
"""
from .class_and_function import Shark, maxi

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# docs > null
from os import abc 

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# docs > Config Parser.md
""" docs : virtual
from configparser import ConfigParser
""" 
```

This `__init__` file naturally controls what is accessible via the Python 
import system when a client executes `import src` (assuming that package can 
be found). The items defined in this file are imported by a Python interpreter. 
They are also auto documented when scanned by this tool, along with processing
the "magic comments" the interpreter ignored.

The following magic comments commands may be included in your `__init__` module.  

**START WRITING**: `# docs > [Page Name].md`

Comment lines which start with this, indicate a starting point 
for what is to be written to a given markdown file. That file/page will be named 
by what follows that `docs >` prefix. Note that the source content indexed and 
included in the resulting file may come from *any* importable module / package 
on your system - not just your source!  

**PROSE**:

```py3
""" docs : prose
This markdown appears where ever you want in the current document.
"""
````

Following this comment pattern, "write" this markdown to the current document.

**PACKAGE DOCSTRING**: `# docs : __doc__` 

Inject the the package doc string into the current document. 


**DISCARD**: `# docs > null`

Discards the documentation for whatever source code follows. 

**VIRTUAL CODE**:

```py3
""" docs > virtual
is_virtual_code_cool = True
"""
````

**VARIABLE UNDEFINED**:

```py3
MY_CONSTANT="brilliance"
""" Here is a docstring for my constant.
docs > var_undef
"""
````

Following this comment pattern, the parsing / object inspecting performed
by the tool will act as though the virtual code were actually present,
but without it having to truly be included in your project.
This provides a means to create documentation in a completely open ended manner
that is is not tightly bound to any literal source.   

## Minimal project layout

  - before pyMkDocs:

>      src/
>          ...         # Other python files or folders

  - after pyMkDocs:

>      mkdocs.yml      # The configuration file.
>
>      src/
>          ...         # Other python files or folders
>
>      docs/
>          index.md    # The documentation homepage.
>          ...         # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
>
>      site/           # The static site ready to be hosted
>          index.html
>          ...

## Custom Content

pyMkDocs is not limited to only generating a site from scratch. Instead, it can 
be dynamically *integrated* with your custom content.  Once you know how, it's 
easy to add your own pages, to add more 
MkDocs [extensions](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#markdown_extensions),
to add [plugins](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#plugins), 
modify the site [theme](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#theme)
and more!  

**Update Mode**

The easiest way to *start* an pyMkDocs project is to first allow the tool to 
create a basic site for you.  After that, you may edit the `mkdocs.yml` file
which was generated.  When the tool is run again subsequently, it will detect
the presence of that prior configuration, and then operate in "update mode".

In "Update Mode", the only part of the `mkdocs.yml` which pyMkDocs will
modify is that found within the "Reference" section.  Anything else which you
customized will be fully preserved and respected while MkDocs regenerates the
site.      

To learn more about how you may modify the `mkdocs.yml` file, see the 
[MkDocs Configuration Guide](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/).

**Hybrid Mode**

An alternative "Hybrid Mode" has also been provided. This a middle ground
between starting from scratch or operating as a pure "update".

To use this method:

- Remove an existing `mkdocs.yml` file (if applicable)
- Create a `docs` folder (if one does not exist)
- Add **your own** Markdown files to the `docs` folder
- Run pyMkDocs!

The result of this will be similiar to creating a whole new site, accept 
your pre-existing Markdown files will be used to generate site pages
and they will be automatically added to the top level of your table of contents! 

**Home Page**

When a vistor first browses to the site, its "Home" page will be displayed.
This page is created from a Markdown file named `index.md` (named like a 
default website page: `index.html`).

If this file does not exist in your `docs` folder, pyMkDocs will generate
a simple placeholder for you. To revise the content of this page, simply
edit, or replace, the `index.md` source.   

## Attribute Docstrings

The formal standards for Python docstrings are defined in 
[PEP-257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).
They do NOT include "attribute docstrings". There is, therefore, no *official* means
to document how to use class and module attributes. The primary reason for this
is because a consensus could not be arrived upon as to what the cleanest
means would be for developers to employ such a standard in practice. Following
the rules for how this is done with modules, classes, and functions
(adding triple double comments after the object signatures), seemed excessive
or confusing to some. Further, there is a belief that attributes should be 
"self documenting", by simply using good names for them.     

That said, it has been suggested that *unofficial* documentation generators
(such as this) may still wish to adhere to the standards proposed in the *rejected* 
[PEP-224](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0224/) or 
[PEP-258](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0258/#attribute-docstrings)
regarding attributes. So, pyMkDocs recognizes those conventions and processes
such comments when generating documentation.

## Recommended Function Docstring
**Code:**
```py3
def fun(arg1: int, arg2: str = 'Hello World!'):
    """Description of your function

    **Parameters**

    > **arg1:** `int` -- Description of argument `arg1`.

    > **arg2:** `str` -- Description of argument `arg2`.

    **Returns**

    > `str` -- Description of returned object.
    """
    return arg2 + str(arg1)
```

can now instantly add to your documentation, leveraging the power of many
[MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org) extensions!

## Now what?
Once you have the source generated for a static website to display your amazing
documentation, how do you make that available to your users / target audience?

Well you may, of course, setup website hosting in any number of manners (which
are all well beyond the scope of this document!). With that done, you could
simply upload the files there. That said, a very notable option for this
specific purpose, which is free, fast, and easy, is to use
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

With GitHub Pages, you may create a *new* GitHub repository dedicated to the 
site, or you may *add* a GitHub Pages site to an *existing* repository (e.g. 
your project source). Arguably, the latter makes more sense if the code you are 
documenting is already on GitHub, or you intend to post it there. For more on 
this see: [Creating a GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)

Note that GitHub Pages allows you to serve your site from either the *root* of 
the repository, or a sub directory named `docs`. There is no option to define
this path yourself, or to use a directory named `site`.  

While GitHub Pages supports Markdown based sites, and can therefore use a 
`docs` directory with such content, it will then convert that to html via a 
seperate mechanism from what you've already produced with MkDocs. If you would 
like to add a GitHub Pages site to an *existing* repository, it is doubtful you
would want it on the *root*, so in order to post your site as it appears locally, 
you will need to place what is normally the "site" content in the `docs` 
directory. Thankfully, this is easy to resolve! Simply rename your folders 
and add the following lines to your `mkdocs.yalm` file:

```
docs_dir: docs_src
site_dir: docs
```

pyMkDocs will then auto generate Markdown into a `docs_src` folder and
MkDocs will generate the website content within `docs`. Problem solved.
